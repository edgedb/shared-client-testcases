# Shared Test Cases for EdgeDB Clients

This repository contains test cases for different EdgeDB client bindings
to implement consistent unit tests for connection parameters parsing,
project handling and so on. [The documentation](
https://www.edgedb.com/docs/reference/connection) explains the fundamentals.

## `connection_testcases.json`

This file contains test cases with different scenarios using the client API,
and the corresponding expected parsed connection parameters. The format is
a list of objects, each may contain the following input/output:

### Input - `opts`

This is usually the values passed directly to the client as options,
like the keyword arguments on `edgedb.create_client(...)` for Python,
or direct command arguments for the CLI. Possible values:

| key                  | value type  | value                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `tlsSecurity`        | enum string | one of `strict`, `no_host_verification` and `insecure` (test cases may contain invalid values)                                                      |
| `tlsCA`              | string      | PEM string of the CA certificate to trust                                                                                                           |

| `serverSettings`     | object      | additional [connection parameters](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/reference/protocol/messages#ref-protocol-msg-client-handshake) to send to the server |
| `credentials`        | JSON string | decodes to an object with possible keys: `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`, `database`, `tls_ca`, `tls_security`                                   |
| `credentialsFile`    | string      | path to a file containing `credentials`                                                                                                             |

Note: some client bindings take a single positional argument
that can be either `dsn` or `instance`, depending on the format.

Note: `database` and `branch` are old and new way of referring to the same concept. They both exist for compatibility reasons during the deprecation period of `database`. They are generally mutually exclusive and must not be used at the same time.

### Input - `fs`

If `fs` is present, the test code should mock up the file system accordingly. Possible keys:

* `cwd` - path to the current working directory as a string to run the test case.
* `homedir` - path to the home directory of the OS user as a string.
* `files` - a mapping of full path of files to their corresponding content.
   * The key is a full path to the file, while the value is the content string of that file.
   * Project stash directory is a special case where there is a `${HASH}` placeholder in the key.
     The test code should replace `${HASH}` with hexadecimal SHA-1 of the full path to the
     project directory specified below. The key represents a directory that contains 2 files
     represented by the value in the form of an object:
      * `instance-name` - contains only the name of the instance in the file content
      * `cloud-profile` - optionally contains only the name of the cloud profile in the file content
      * `project-path` - a symlink pointing to the full path to the project directory in the value

### Input - `platform`

Value can be one of `macos` or `windows`, specifies the OS to run this test case.
This is only useful when `fs` is present.

If `platform` is absent while `fs` is present, the OS should be Linux.

### Output - `error`

Expected error, value is currently an object with a single key `type`.
The value of `type` is an idendifier-like string indicating the actual
expected error, the test code should map this identifier to an actual
error type or message.

`result` and `error` are mutually exclusive.

### Output - `warning`

A list of identifier-like strings that this test case should emit.
